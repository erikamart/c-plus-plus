Lesson 4 Instructions:
Objective: To experience coding, desk checking, compiling, correcting and executing an actual C++ program.

Assignment:
    1) "Complete" the balloon program you wrote the IPO for in Lesson 3 by turning it into C++ code. Be sure to use a constant for PI.

    2) Create a new project. Call it "balloonsProject".

    3) Click Project then "Add New Item" to make the area where you can enter the C++ code. 
        * Call the C++ program lesson4Code - that is, you are creating a new file called "lesson4Code.cpp".
        * Be sure you include your name in a comment block at the top.
    4) Type in your program. Be sure to save all when you are complete.
    5) Compile your program. Correct any errors until the compile is successful.
    6) Execute your program and test it to be sure it works and produces the correct result.
