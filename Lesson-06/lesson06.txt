Lesson 6 Instructions:
Objectives: Develop a program with selection structure constructs in C++ programming.

Assignment:
    1) Consider the following computer programming problem:
    Hammerschlag Corp needs a program to help compute raises for their employees. When the program begins, the user will be prompted to enter a current salary. Then a raise will be computed according to the following table:      

    Old Salary                  Raise
    up to $14,999.99            5%
    $15,000.00 to $49,999.99    7%
    $50,000.00 to $99,999.99    10%
    $100,000.00 and higher      15%

    After the raise is determined, it will be added to the current salary to give the new salary. There will be 2 outputs - the raise and the new salary, then the program will stop.

    For example, if a current salary of $35200.00 were entered, the program would display: You will receive a raise of $2464.00, for a new yearly salary of $37664.00. (You can use this for test data.)

    Notes:
        * Money data input and output should handle/show decimals. Show a dollar sign on the input prompt, and on the output - along with 2 decimal places only. 
        * Use no "commas" for larger numbers though. (i.e. $123456.00 not $123,456.00)
        * Remember that dollar signs are for display only - you CANNOT use dollar signs inside IF statements!

        * Don't worry about rounding, ignore that.
        * Obviously, you need to use a series of IF statements to process the raise.
        * There are 2 ways to do that - either a series of several separate IF statements each using a logic function (AND, which is && in C++) OR
        * You may nest the IF statements, in which case you do not need, and may not use any logic functions.
        * Pick ONE of these and do it, if you mix nesting with logic you will overcomplicate the problem and will lose points.
        * Your Instructor will not test your program with any inputs other than numeric values, so no error checking at all is needed - and none is allowed. * Do not declare any constants in the program - they are not needed.
        * Remember good coding standards - appropriate variable names and good comments, and an easy to read (well-spaced) program.

    2) Write up an IPO chart for this problem. Be sure to have an "Input, Processing, Output and Algorithm" part. 
    
    3) Desk-check your solution.

Salary Problem
Input: baseSalary

Processing: raiseRate

Output: raise, newSalary

Algorithm:
1.  enter the baseSalary
2.  some IF statements for the logic
      if baseSalary is less than or equal to 14,999.99 
raiseRate = .05
      end if
      if baseSalary is greater than or equal to 15000.00 AND less than or equal to 49999.99
 raiseRate = .07
      end if 
       if baseSalary is greater than or equal to 50000.00 AND less than or equal to 99999.99
             raiseRate = .10
       end if
       if baseSalary is greater than or equal to 100000.00
raiseRate = .15
       end if
3. raise = raiseRate * baseSalary
    newSalary = baseSalary + raise
4. display raise, newSalary
End
