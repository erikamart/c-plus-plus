Lesson 9 Instructions:

Objectives: (SLOs)
    * Identify the use of a function (3)
    * Identify the "pow" function to raise a number to a power (3)
    * Identify the "sqrt" function to return the square root of a number (3) * Show a function to generate random numbers (3 )
    * Recognize all the parts of a function prototype (3)
    * Recognize the scope and lifetime properties of a variable (4)
    * Identify some useful real-world C++ functions (3)

Assignment: 
    1) Read and study Chapter 9 in the textbook, "An introduction to Programming with C++ by Diane Zak, 7th ed.".

    2) Skim the Chapter Summary and Key Terms at the end of the Chapter.

    3) Attempt the Mini-Quizzes and Review Questions at the end of the Chapter to help prepare you for the Quiz.

    4) Complete Lesson 9 Quiz.

    5) Complete the Discussion Board post for Lesson 9.
        * Prepare a Discussion Board post:
        Functions make a language tremendously useful and flexible - chances are that someone has written one to do something you need, and you can
        just use it rather than writing code from scratch.
        * To begin, search the Internet for any reference which contains useful functions you can use in C++ - any function library at all EXCEPT math, since we have already seen that one. There are functions that help with Databasing, Internet use, science or engineering, graphics, gaming - you name it.
        * Find your item, study it, and then write a one-third page summary of what the functions you found are all about, what they do, who can use them, etc. in your own words.
        * Note the URL (http://) where you found your info, you will include it after your summary.

        We frequently are working with strings in programs, whether it be in a text editor or a web browser. One of the most useful functions for working with strings is the .length() function; also known as strlen(). This is a simple function in the library that will take a string and return the number of characters within it. You should use the .length() method, for standard types of strings, with the #include<string> directive and the strlen() method, for c-style strings, with the #include <cstring> directive. Use of either, depends on the compiler you are using and the string type.
        
        When would this function be useful? I find it most useful when you are building forms for customers to fill out online. This function will allow the input to be compared against the form requirements set for the form to be completed correctly.
        
        Let us say you are building a website where you want to have users create accounts with logins and passwords and you want the password to be at least 8 characters long. Below is a code that uses the appropriate directive and function to display the amount of characters if the user tried to input “Pass1” as their password.
        
        Sample Program:

        #include <iostream>
        #include <string>
        using namespace std;
        int main()
        {
            string userInput = "";
            
            cout << "Enter a password: ";
            cin >> userInput;

                if (userInput.length() < 8)
                {
                    cout << "Invalid. Your password has " << userInput.length() << " characters." << endl;
                } //end if

            //pause output
            system("pause");
            return 0;
        } //end main

        The end result of the input is that an error message will appear displaying the number 5 since the string, “Pass1”, consists of 5 characters.
