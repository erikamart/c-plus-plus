## Software/Materials Needed  
-  The book used was "An introduction to Programming with C++" by Diane Zak, 7th ed. 
   -  The 8th edition can also be used.

-  Windows or Mac Computer

- Windows program to install is [Microsoft Visual Studio Express 2015](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/older-downloads/)  
  - *NOTE: After clicking the link provided, find the year "2015", click on it, and click the Download button.*
  - Install can take several hours and a computer reboot can happen up to 2 times.
  - Sign in with your microsoft account if you like but otherwise it is not necessary.

## File Structure
- Follow the folders sequentially; they each follow the book chapters sequentially as well.  

- Within each Lesson folder is a text file with the same name that starts out with objectives & instructions and then gives an assignment to solve.
  - NOTE: I did not write the assignments or quizzes and do not take credit for that. They are included to show the solutions & answers I did write.  

  - After the assignment instructions will be my written solution. 
- Included in some folders are 1 or all of:
  - a .cpp file with my assignment solution.
  - a .doc file with my IPO solution.
  - a quiz text file with questions that I did not write, but my chosen answers to the questions.
  - a sub folder with my offical solution to the assignments.
